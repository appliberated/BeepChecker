# BeepChecker

BeepChecker is a tiny portable Windows program that plays the standard Windows beep sounds: the Information, Question, Warning, or Error sounds. It also lets you play custom beeps by generating simple tones on the speaker.

Use BeepChecker to familiarize yourself with the sound of the different standard Windows beeps, and learn to differentiate between them. Check the system sounds configuration on your PC, or check system sounds across Windows versions and virtual machines. Hardware enthusiast? Test if the beep sounds are generated by the internal PC speaker or by the sound card.

BeepChecker is very easy to use: you can simply download the tiny executable file and run it directly, without installation. The tidy user interface has a Play button and a description label for each type of beep, and frequency and duration input boxes for generating the custom beep.
